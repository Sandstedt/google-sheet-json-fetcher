# google-sheet-json-fetcher

A small vue.js app for fetching JSON data in a very opinionated way from Google Sheet

Try it out here: https://google-sheet-data.jonassandstedt.now.sh

You can use [this file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15_4BWf1UIexlnh4qXlYcT89LgQIXHl-HlXYM0d55xRg/edit?usp=sharing) as a template for the data if you want.

## Cell formatting
The options I have is that you can create arrays in cells with ", " seperating the items:
Item1, Item2, Item3

If you need a comma in the text cell and don't want to get an array, wrap them in quotes: "Some text, with a comma".
